      - name: Package wasm
        run: wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir pkg
        # This creates the 'pkg' directory in the root of the repo

      # Step 2: Install Node.js dependencies
      # This step should run `npm install` to get `webpack`, `webpack-cli`, etc.

      # Step 3: Run the webpack build
      # This step executes the "build" script from your package.json,
      # which bundles all assets, including the WASM files from 'pkg',
      # into your final output directory (e.g., www/dist).
      - name: Build frontend with webpack

      # Step 5: Upload the final build artifact
      - name: Upload artifact

        with:
          # This must point to the directory created by your webpack build.
          # The common default is 'www/dist', but double-check your
          # webpack.config.js `output.path` to be sure.
